# Building-user-based-recommendation-model-for-Amazon
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Which movies have maximum views/ratings? What is the average rating for each movie? Define the top 5 movies with the maximum ratings. Define the top 5 movies with the least audience.

Recommendation Model: Some of the movies hadnâ€™t been watched and therefore, are not rated by the users. Netflix would like to take this as an opportunity and build a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users.
Divide the data into training and test data Build a recommendation model on training data Make predictions on the test data
